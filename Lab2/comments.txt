It seems that we caught most of the functional dependencies in Task 1.
They were all already keys in our relational schema
so no modifications were made due to these FDs in the new schema.

We did however realize that our reference in relation WaitsFor was falsely pointing
at Courses.code instead of RestrictedCourse.code

######################## New stuff ###################

There exists a circular dependency for the MastersAt relation.
This was already caught in our schema from lab1 with the line
(student, studyProgramme) -> Students.(id, studyProgramme)
In other words. The student may only master at branches of his or her own studyprogramme.

A student must meet the requirements for each course
before he can register for it.
A student shan't be able to register for a course he has passed.
We do not have the tools to capture these constraints in the schema however. So this will have to be done in a later stage.
